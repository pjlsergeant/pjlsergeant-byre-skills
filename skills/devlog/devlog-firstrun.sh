# devlog firstrun hook — runs as the dev user, each launch, before the agent
# starts. Ensures the project's .byre-devlog/ dir exists and is self-ignoring
# (see byre_devlog_dir in the shared lib), so the agent diary and review log
# persist via the workspace mount but never land in git, with no per-project
# .gitignore entry. Idempotent; best-effort (must never block launch) — but
# audible: the lib's stand-down warning must reach the launch output.
